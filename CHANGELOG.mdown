### v2.0.0
* Breaking changes to AES support
  - Moving to [SJCL](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/) compatible AES
  - AES now uses only authenticated modes ("GCM" and "CCM")
  - Deprecating streaming and file AES encryption. This would be better handled
    by another library. Gibberish will focus on compatibility with Javascript/Browser encryption.
  - Legacy encryption/decryption has not been removed. You can still encrypt and decrypt
    older Gibberish generated AES ciphertexts, but you must call it explicitly
* Breaking change to HMAC - User must explicitly choose a digest. No longer defaults to SHA1
* Deprecating Ruby 1.9.3 since its OpenSSL bindings do not allow for authenticated modes
* Remove RSA/PGP - There's alot of complexity here. This would better be handled by
  another library.
